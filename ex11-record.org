* Read from file
1. =telephone.in= is a file.  It is a sequence of
   lines. Each line has two fields, separated by =|=
   character. 
   1. Number
   2. Name

2. Define =Entry= as a structure composed of =number= and
   =name=. Define an array of pointers to =Entry=
   structures. 
3. Write a function =read_telephones()= that reads the file
   and converts each line to an =Entry= structure, and
   stores them in the array of pointers to =Entry=
   structures.
4. Write a function =print_entries()= to display the entries
   in the array to =stdout=. 

* Search for an entry
1. Define a function =search_number()= that searches for a given
   number and prints the number and the name.
2. Define a function =search_name()= that searches for a given
   name and prints the number and the name. You can search
   for a substring using the library function =strstr()=.

* Insert an entry
Write a function =insert_entry()= that reads a name and number
from the user and adds it to the array. If the number
already exists, it should not be inserted.

* Delete an entry
Write a function =delete_entry()= that reads a number from
the user and deletes it from the array. When you delete an
entry, pack the array by moving the subsequent entries up.

* Interactive loop
Write a loop that interacts with the user: It reads one of
the options from the user and performs the function.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
q quit 
s number (search for a number)
f name (search for a name)
i number name (insert an entry (number, name))
d number (delete the entry with the number)
#+END_EXAMPLE 
When the program quits, the array of =Entry= structures
should be written to the =telephone.in= file.
